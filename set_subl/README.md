# st_sub
This is my auto settings for sublime 3. It will auto install package control and a few other packages. I'll add more setting files later.

It's a bash script works for both windows and Linux sublime(tested on windows server 2008 and Ubuntu 14.04), but don't try it in CMD or powershell. On windows, it's a good idea to install git first and run it in git bash.

Currently it doesn't auto install sublime, so manually installation is needed, and the script only support default installation path.
